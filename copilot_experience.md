# My GitHub Copilot Experience - Week 2
## What Worked Well


When the comments did work with Copilot it was very helpful and I was able to progress quickly through the code. I used it, as the assignment requested, to create the dictionary of basic math operations as well as perform basic calculations. I even was able to give more suggestions to copilot through the comments like #copilot add ___ here and then it would do it. 

## Challenges

Copilot did not create the function to actually perform the calculation, no matter how many times I entered the comment. 
It was very frustrating. I had to do a ton of research online to figure out how to actually have it process the test equations. When I did figure it out, all of the answers were floating point numbers and were not rounding which led to me having errors in python (i dont' know python) and had to figure out how to round the number. The sample code in the pdf in blackboard didnt have detailed enough instructions on how to make the solve for x function and I've never learned python before so this assignment was very challenging because I could not understand basic syntax and language requirements.

## Prompt Engineering Tips I Learned

1. I learned through this assignment to write multiple comments offering suggestions about what the code should do first and what you want the outcome to be. 

2. A couple of times I was able to have copilot teach me what was happening by pre-writing a comment and having it make a suggestion to finish it like, "#this function solves for x in simple equations using a search method" this is helpful especially when you don't know python or the language you are working with. 

3. When typing in the comments its helpful to start the comment like #when this function starts it is ______ and have it fill in the blank to get a better understanding of syntax.

4. You can break your code down into steps by having co-pilot finish your comments for you to get a better understanding of what is happening. '#step 1 is to ____"

5. Start out comments with "#this works by ___________" and having copilot finish it.

## Code Copilot Generated
1. #this function visualizes the search process by showing step by step calculations
2. #this works by checking if the difference between result and its rounded value is very small

## My Productivity Assessment
On a scale of 1-10, Copilot improved my coding speed by:

Co-pilot improved my coding on a scale of 6.5/10. When it was helpful, it was quick and efficient. The most trouble I had was when I ran into syntax errors in the terminal and when It would not finish my comment or help me understand the process which made the code tremendously difficult and for that reason alone I would not rely on it without knowing the language I am using in VS code. I would use it for saving time on typing arrays, dictionaries and more tedious and monotonous work, but when there is more logic involved I will likely not rely on it.
